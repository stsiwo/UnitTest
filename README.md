# Unit Testing explained with PHPUnit and Mockery in Laravel 5.4

Through my work experience as a PHP developer, I oftenly encountered projects which don't write/execute unit testing. Actually, when I start my career, I didn't even know how to write unit testing. Writing code Without unit testing means that you have to make sure a method/class you implemented works correctly manually. This is really time-consuming task and I did manual testing so many time. 

In order to acquire unit testing skill, I red a textbook, "Practical Unit Testing with JUnit and Mockito".
